Abstract

The human gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem essential for health, can be disrupted by dysbiosis linked to various diseases. Recent interest has centered on Blastocystis, a common gut protozoan, to determine its impact on microbiota and host health. Although traditionally viewed as a pathogen, emerging evidence suggests Blastocystis may function as a commensal. This study explores the relationship between Blastocystis colonization, burden levels, and gut microbiota composition in a rural population, which differs significantly from urban settings in terms of diet and environment.
We analyzed intestinal microbiota using 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing, comparing individuals with and without Blastocystis. Results showed that Blastocystis-positive individuals had higher bacterial richness and distinct microbial profiles. Specifically, taxa such as Bacteroides uniformis, Oscillibacter sp., and Prevotella copri were more prevalent in the Blastocystis-positive group, indicating a potential beneficial role of the protozoan. Additionally, the eukaryotic microbiota analysis revealed increased Entamoeba coli in Blastocystis-positive individuals, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans were more common in Blastocystis-negative individuals. A random forest classifier predicted Blastocystis colonization with an out-of-bag error rate of 23.86%, highlighting key taxa like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides ovatus. These findings suggest that Blastocystis may enhance microbiota diversity and stability.
In conclusion, Blastocystis colonization is associated with a more diverse and functionally beneficial gut microbiota, challenging its traditional pathogenic view. This study underscores the protozoan's potential to support a balanced microbial community, particularly in rural environments, and points to the need for further research on its role in gut health.
